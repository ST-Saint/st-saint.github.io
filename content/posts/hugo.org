* 使用不同主题
+ hugo 并不支持在一个site中使用多个theme
** Solution
+ 在不同子路径下创建多个仓库生成不同站点，生成到同一个public目录下

* DateFormat
+ 折磨
+ 文章 ~date~ 字段需要是以下格式
#+begin_src go
const (
	Layout      = "01/02 03:04:05PM '06 -0700" // The reference time, in numerical order.
	ANSIC       = "Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 2006"
	UnixDate    = "Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 MST 2006"
	RubyDate    = "Mon Jan 02 15:04:05 -0700 2006"
	RFC822      = "02 Jan 06 15:04 MST"
	RFC822Z     = "02 Jan 06 15:04 -0700" // RFC822 with numeric zone
	RFC850      = "Monday, 02-Jan-06 15:04:05 MST"
	RFC1123     = "Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 MST"
	RFC1123Z    = "Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 -0700" // RFC1123 with numeric zone
	RFC3339     = "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
	RFC3339Nano = "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00"
	Kitchen     = "3:04PM"
	// Handy time stamps.
	Stamp      = "Jan _2 15:04:05"
	StampMilli = "Jan _2 15:04:05.000"
	StampMicro = "Jan _2 15:04:05.000000"
	StampNano  = "Jan _2 15:04:05.000000000"
)
#+end_src

+ 在 ~config.yaml~ 中可以设置 ~DateFormat~, format 格式为
  + example: =DateFormat: "Jan 02, 2006  Mon 15:04"=
